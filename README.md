# Shop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.10.

## Remarks

The project has been built for 10 hours and includes some extra features. Data is being saved on service level.

*When uploading an image, try to hold back from adding a heavy one. `SVG` is a perfect fit for the current API in use.*

I used Angular Material, PrimeFlex and PrimeIcons to buy time. Nevertheless, there's a lot of styles that I wrote on my own. 
Particular code parts can be refactored in the future and meet SOLID pattern requirements better.

Best regards!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
