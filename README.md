# Shop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.10.

## Remarks

The project has been built for 10 hours and includes some extra features that you might like. However, this time was not enough
to complete e2e tests and implement storage for added products via local storage or database (API which was used rejects saving data on server. It was not known by the time to implement the feature).
Thus, data is being saved on service level and exists while the server keeps existing.

I spent some time working on design and responsive layout, so I look forward to hear from you about the application appearance, broadly speaking. 

*When uploading an image, try to hold back from adding a heavy one. `SVG` is a perfect fit for the current API in use.*

I used Angular Material, PrimeFlex and PrimeIcons to buy me some time. Nevertheless, there's a lot of styles that I wrote on my own. 
Particular code parts can be refactored in the future and meet SOLID pattern requirements better.

In conclusion, this app is a prototype and does not represent the comprehensive solution I'd like to demonstrate, however, it does show the capacity 
I can provide for 10 hours.

Hope, you'll run the application to see the result :) 

Best regards!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
